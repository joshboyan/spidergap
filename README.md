# Coding challenge from spidergap.

This repo houses code for two coding challenges:

- Deep clone an object [deepclone.js](https://github.com/joshboyan/spidergap/blob/master/deepclone.js).
- Parse a JOSN object of business partners and return a list of partners within 100km based on their office GPS coordinates [haversine.js](https://github.com/joshboyan/spidergap/blob/master/haversine.js).

## Check the work

The entry point to run these exercises is index.js.
If you download the repo it is also a node package. `cd` into the main directory and run `npm start` to see the output from both files. Run `npm test` to see the output of the unit test written with mocha and chai.

Thanks for taking the time to look!
